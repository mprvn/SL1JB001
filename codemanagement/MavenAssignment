            i.Hints:
                1.You may need to add following dependency in the project
                    <dependency>
                        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
                        <scope>provided</scope>
                    </dependency>
                2.And, you may need to add following code to Spring Boot Main Class.
                    @SpringBootApplicationpublic 
                    class Application  extends SpringBootServletInitializer{
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                            SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
                        }
                    }
                3.SpringBootServletInitializer is imported from 
                    org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.SpringBootServletInitializer
    5.Jetty is the light weight servlet container.Add jetty dependency to the POM.xml
        a.You can get the Jetty dependency from 
        https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-maven-pluginb.Execute the project using jetty
